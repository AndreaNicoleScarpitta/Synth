That field is called Pediatric Cardiology, with a subfocus in Pediatric Hemodynamics or Pediatric Cardiovascular Physiology—specifically involving blood flow, oxygenation, and pressure dynamics in the developing heart. It often supports research and clinical innovation in congenital heart defects, pediatric heart failure, and procedural planning for interventional cardiology or surgery.

Here’s a fully flushed-out synthetic data use case targeted at pediatric cardiology and hemodynamics:

Use Case: Synthetic Data for Pediatric Cardiovascular Modeling

Title:

Simulating Pediatric Hemodynamic Profiles for Congenital Heart Disease Research and Intervention Design


---

Background:

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting nearly 1% of live births. Pediatric cardiologists and biomedical engineers must model cardiovascular dynamics in children to:

Design surgical interventions (e.g. Fontan procedure, arterial switch)

Evaluate drug safety in immature circulatory systems

Predict long-term outcomes across growth stages


Yet pediatric hemodynamic data is scarce, fragmented, and ethically challenging to collect due to IRB restrictions, lack of large-scale registries, and the high risk associated with invasive data collection in children.


---

Job to Be Done (JTBD):

> “As a pediatric cardiologist or biomedical researcher, I need access to detailed, privacy-safe physiological datasets of children with congenital heart conditions so I can simulate blood flow, test interventions, and train AI models without real patient risk.”

Actors:

Buyer: Head of Pediatric Research or Chief Medical Officer at a pediatric hospital or device company

Users: Pediatric cardiologists, biomedical engineers, clinical data scientists

Stakeholders: Surgical planning teams, pharma teams testing pediatric indications, regulatory affairs teams

How the Synthetic EHR Platform Helps:

1. Synthetic Dataset Generation

Select patient profiles: e.g., neonates to adolescents with Tetralogy of Fallot, Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, or coarctation of the aorta

Auto-generate high-fidelity physiological time series:

Heart rate variability

Stroke volume

Aortic/ventricular pressures

Oxygen saturation gradients

Cardiac index across growth stages


Include linked clinical notes, medication history, procedure timelines, and diagnostic imaging summaries


2. Continuous Knowledge Updates

AI agents crawl literature from PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and pediatric cardiology journals

Automatically enrich the simulation engine with updated diagnostic criteria, pharmacologic safety data, and procedural techniques (e.g., updated guidelines for Fontan candidacy)


3. Simulation & Modeling

Biomedical engineers simulate:

Blood flow pre/post surgical repair

Impact of stent sizing in growing vasculature

Drug absorption rates in pediatric circulation


Cardiologists run decision-support tests: e.g., “If we delay surgery by 6 months, what’s the projected RV pressure at age 5?”


4. Regulatory & Research Use

Researchers export synthetic cohorts for ML model training (e.g., early detection of post-op complications)

Regulatory teams simulate safety scenarios across diverse pediatric subpopulations for FDA pediatric extrapolation pathways



---

Benefits:

Speed: Simulate rare pediatric cases without waiting for limited patient encounters

Safety: Avoid exposing real children to modeling risk

Coverage: Fill in missing cohorts (e.g., children from underrepresented ethnic groups or specific age/weight bands)

Compliance: Avoid PHI risk while preparing models and regulatory documentation



---

Narrative Summary:

> A pediatric cardiac device company is designing a next-gen ventricular assist device (VAD) for children under 12. They lack access to sufficient EHR data for validation and modeling. Using our synthetic data engine, they generate thousands of patient records mimicking real hemodynamic profiles across CHD types and developmental stages. Biomedical engineers simulate device performance; clinicians validate protocol safety; the regulatory team uses synthetic cohorts to support FDA discussions—all without needing IRB approval or risking patient exposure.
