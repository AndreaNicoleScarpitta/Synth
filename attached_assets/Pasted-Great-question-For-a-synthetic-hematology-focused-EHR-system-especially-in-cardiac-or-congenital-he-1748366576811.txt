Great question. For a synthetic hematology-focused EHR system‚Äîespecially in cardiac or congenital heart contexts‚Äîthe overview dashboard should help users (clinicians, researchers, AI modelers) quickly:

    Understand cohort characteristics

    Explore disease progression trends

    Identify treatment-response patterns

    Inspect agent validation and rejection reasons

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what your Overview Dashboard should include:
üß¨ 1. Cohort Composition Panel

High-level metrics summarizing your synthetic patient population.
Metric	Description
Total synthetic patients	e.g., 5,000
CHD subtype distribution	% Tetralogy of Fallot, HLHS, CoA, etc.
Hematologic comorbidities	e.g., % with thrombophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
Age distribution	Median age, pediatric stage buckets (neonates, infants, etc.)
Sex distribution	% Male / Female / Intersex
Record length	Avg. timeline length (days/months per patient)
ü©∏ 2. Hematology-Specific Lab Trends Panel

Visualize how key blood parameters change over time or differ by subgroup.
Chart Type	Analytics
Time-series line chart	Hemoglobin & platelet trends post-surgery
Box plots by cohort	INR, PT, aPTT distribution per CHD type
Correlation heatmap	Anticoagulant dosage vs. bleeding risk or INR
Incidence bars	Frequency of DVT/PE or thrombosis by condition & age group
üíâ 3. Treatment Protocols & Intervention Overview

How synthetic patients were managed therapeutically.
Metric / Chart	Description
Anticoagulant usage breakdown	% on Warfarin, Heparin, DOACs
Transfusion heatmap	Volume & frequency by timeline stage
Therapy timelines	Sankey or Gantt showing when meds were initiated/discontinued
Agentic decision trace	Why treatment was chosen (agent prompt input + context)
üß† 4. Adversarial Agent Feedback Summary

Transparency into your AI agent system‚Äîwhat was generated, validated, or rejected.
Panel	Insights
‚úÖ Accepted vs ‚ùå Rejected records	% accepted, top rejection reasons
Model disagreement map	Realism agent vs. relevance agent ‚Äî where did they disagree?
Audit trace viewer	For each patient: what was generated, critiqued, revised
Confidence calibration	Histogram of realism scores, temperature settings used
üìà 5. Outcomes and Complications Analytics

Synthetic modeling of clinical endpoints.
Chart	Details
Outcome funnel	Mortality ‚Üí complications ‚Üí discharge state
Readmission/relapse curve	Cumulative events over synthetic time
Cause-specific event simulation	Bleeding, clotting, surgical failure patterns
Multi-factor analysis	E.g., transfusion volume + INR + surgery = clotting outcome score
üîç 6. Filter & Exploration Controls

Allow users to drill into synthetic subcohorts.
Filter	Example Options
CHD Subtype	HLHS, CoA, Tetralogy, VSD
Age Range	0‚Äì1 yr, 1‚Äì5 yrs, etc.
Condition	Anemia, thrombophilia, thrombocytopenia
Intervention	Anticoagulant used, transfusion received
Validation status	Accepted, Rejected, Reworked
