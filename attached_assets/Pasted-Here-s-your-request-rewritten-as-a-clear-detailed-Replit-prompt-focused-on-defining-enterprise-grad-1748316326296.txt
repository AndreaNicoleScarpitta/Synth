Here’s your request rewritten as a clear, detailed Replit prompt—focused on defining enterprise-grade criteria for agentic AI systems and programmatic modules, with traceability, testing, and observability:


---

Prompt:

> I’m building an enterprise-grade agentic AI system in Replit. I need clear, enforceable “Definition of Done” (DoD) standards for:

Agentic AI agents

Traditional programmatic components


These standards will ensure the system is production-ready, testable, explainable, and safe for regulated environments like healthcare.




---

Definition of Done (Applies to All Components)

1. Context Traceability

Every generated dataset or response from an agent must include:

The original prompt or research question

The retrieved documents or context (RAG sources) used to inform the generation

Metadata such as agent name, model version, timestamp, and configuration (e.g., temperature, filters)



2. Follow-up Support

All outputs must be linked to a mechanism that allows:

Users to ask follow-up questions

Agents to retrace reasoning paths or offer citations

The system to explain why a decision or generation was made



3. Unit & Integration Tests

Every agent and traditional component must include:

Unit tests for internal logic, validation rules, and transformation steps

Mocked tests for agent behavior and expected outputs under known conditions

Integration tests to ensure multi-agent workflows function as intended



4. Deployment Gatekeeping

CI/CD pipeline must enforce:

Pre-deployment test suites (pass/fail blocking gates)

Validation checks for all agents’ output formats

Logs of failed assertions and rollback policies



5. Observability

Include logging and visualization tools that allow:

Real-time agent monitoring

Replay of previous agent runs and outputs

Clear distinction between accepted and rejected generations



6. Usability & Transparency

UI must allow users to:

View which outputs were discounted, why, and by which agent

Adjust agent confidence thresholds (e.g., realism tolerance)

Inspect the full generation path from input to output




---

Build the system architecture and codebase in Replit using these DoD rules.
All components (agentic and programmatic) must be versioned, testable, auditable, and traceable—ready for healthcare and research-grade deployments.

Let me know if you want this scaffolded as a starter repo with folder structures for agents, tests, logging, and deployment hooks.
