🧾 Synthetic Ascension Overview & Summary Reports

Purpose: Help all personas—technical and non-technical—quickly understand what was generated, how it behaves, and how it can be used.
1. 🧬 Synthetic Cohort Summary Report

    “What’s in this synthetic dataset?”

Key Fields:

    Cohort Name / UUID

    N (Patient Count): e.g., 2,000 records

    Vertical: Rare Disease, Pediatrics, Cardiology, Oncology, etc.

    Configured Diagnoses: e.g., Turner Syndrome, Cystic Hygroma

    Associated Modalities: Ultrasound, Labs, Genetics, Notes, etc.

    Data Range: e.g., 10–22 gestational weeks

    Simulation Settings: Bias controls, label noise, edge cases

    Generated On / By: Timestamp + generation config fingerprint

    Reproducibility Hash: For validation & audit

Visuals:

    Pie/bar charts: diagnosis distribution, outcome rates

    Timeline heatmaps: GA at diagnosis, delivery, intervention

    Modalities matrix: % completeness per data type

2. 🧠 Synthetic Patient Snapshot Report

    “Show me a sample record in depth.”

Key Panels:

    Demographics & Pregnancy Info

    Diagnosis Timeline

    Ultrasound Summary: NT, septation, findings

    Genetic Report: Diagnostic method, karyotype, interpretation

    Lab Summary: PAPP-A, HCG, cfDNA

    Clinical Notes (Synthetic): Generated SOAP or counseling notes

    Outcome: Live birth / stillbirth / termination

    Agent Trace Log: Which models contributed to which fields

Visuals:

    Scrollable clinical timeline

    Structured + free-text sections

    Inline flags: “Edge case,” “Label noise injected,” “Outlier: Yes”

3. 📊 Population Health Analytics Report

    “What can I infer about this synthetic population?”

Key Metrics:

    Demographic Distribution: Age, sex, SES, race

    Comorbidity Prevalence

    Genetic Abnormality Rates

    Outcome by Diagnosis: e.g., survival rate by NT tier or karyotype

    Synthetic Fidelity:

        Label noise %

        Unrealistic timelines detected

        Prompt realism scores (if LLM-generated notes)

Visuals:

    Sankey: diagnosis → intervention → outcome

    Divergence maps (synthetic vs. known real-world benchmarks)

    Cohort integrity indicators: completeness, imbalance, bias warnings

4. 🧾 Modality Coverage Report

    “What structured and unstructured data is present, and how well?”

Modality	Coverage Rate	Fidelity Score	Notes
Ultrasound	100%	High	Includes septation flags
Genetic Reports	90%	Medium	Missing fields in 10%
Labs	75%	High	Values within expected range
Clinical Notes	60%	Variable	LLM-generated, flagged 8% for hallucination
Outcome Labels	100%	High	Matches configured ratios

Useful for QA, modeler trust, and clinical validation.
5. 🧾 Export / Distribution Summary Report

    “Where did this data go?”

Key Fields:

    Export Format(s): JSON, FHIR, Langflow YAML, CSV

    # Downloads or Clones

    Linked Agents / Consumers: e.g., “Fed to BioGPT RAG pipeline”

    Downstream Apps: Langflow chains, LLM fine-tuning, dashboards

    Expiration Date / Regeneration Required?: for time-limited datasets

Visuals:

    Timeline of use: generation → QA → export → downstream use

    “Footprint” map: where the synthetic data was used internally or externally

6. 🔐 Audit & Lineage Summary Report

    “How was this dataset generated and modified?”

Key Sections:

    Generation Config Snapshot: YAML spec

    Model Lineage: Which base models were used (e.g., GPT-4-tuned, MedPaLM, Claude)

    Transformations Applied: Bias correction, LLM post-processing, validation layers

    Version History: Changes made, fields added/removed, regen logs

    Signed Manifest: For reproducibility and regulatory review

🔁 Integration into Platform UX

These reports would show up as:

    Tabbed views in a cohort details page

    PDF or JSON exports for buyer demos, trials, or regulatory submission

    Modular embeds inside Langflow, Replit, or custom front ends
