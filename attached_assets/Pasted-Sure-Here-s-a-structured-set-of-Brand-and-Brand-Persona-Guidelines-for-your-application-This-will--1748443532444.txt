Brand Guidelines

1. Brand Name

Let me know if you already have a name. For now, I'll refer to it as "MedSynth" (synthetic EHR generator).

2. Brand Purpose

To unlock innovation in healthcare and AI by providing rich, privacy-safe synthetic patient data for research, model training, and product development—without compromising real human health records.

3. Vision Statement

A future where data silos, bias, and privacy concerns no longer limit medical progress.

4. Mission Statement

To generate and validate synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) that are statistically accurate, regulation-friendly, and built to accelerate AI and medical research.

5. Core Values

Integrity: No shortcuts with data fidelity or privacy.

Empowerment: Fuel innovation across healthtech, pharma, and research.

Transparency: Every dataset is auditable, explainable, and tunable.

Inclusion: Ensure underrepresented groups are modeled and supported.

Excellence: Built for scale, accuracy, and enterprise compliance.

Brand Persona Guidelines

1. Brand Archetype

The Sage
MedSynth seeks truth, insight, and understanding. It helps others make informed decisions using trustworthy data.

2. Personality Traits

Authoritative but approachable: Like a trusted medical researcher who explains complexity clearly.

Precise and technical: Accuracy is non-negotiable; no hand-waving.

Visionary yet pragmatic: Shows the future, but always grounded in what’s buildable now.

Supportive mentor: Helps clients explore the edge of what’s possible with synthetic data.


3. Voice & Tone

Context	Voice	Tone

Product Interface	Clear, direct, technically confident	Professional and minimal
Marketing Copy	Insightful, inspiring, visionary	Hopeful, bold, a touch poetic
Technical Documentation	Structured, precise, explanatory	Neutral and educational

Visual Identity (High-Level)

(Can be refined with a designer later)

1. Color Palette

Primary: Deep Blue (trust), Emerald Green (health), Soft White (clarity)

Secondary: Slate Gray (stability), Signal Orange (insightful highlights)


2. Typography

Display Font: Montserrat or Inter — modern, clean, accessible

Body Font: Source Sans Pro or Roboto — readable in dense data settings


3. Logo Guidance

Should incorporate an abstract “organism” or “circuit” motif to represent synthetic biology and AI

Should be scalable from favicon to billboard

Ideally adaptable to dark and light themes


4. Iconography

Use outlined icons for modular steps

Prefer anatomical, data-related, or workflow motifs

Avoid cartoonish or overly techy styles (like floating brains or matrix code)

Would you like this turned into a PDF brand book, or a slide template for team-wide onboarding? I can also tailor it further based on specific verticals (e.g., pharma vs AI/MedTech) or tone preferences (e.g., more corporate, more rebellious, more academic).
