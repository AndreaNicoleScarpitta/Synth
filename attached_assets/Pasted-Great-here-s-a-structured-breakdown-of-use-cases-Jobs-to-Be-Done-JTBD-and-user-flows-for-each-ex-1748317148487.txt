Great—here’s a structured breakdown of use cases, Jobs to Be Done (JTBD), and user flows for each executive buyer and power user persona in pharma. Each flow connects your synthetic EHR platform directly to their goals and pain points.


---

1. Chief Data Officer (CDO) / VP of Data Science

JTBD:

“I need to accelerate model development and validation without waiting months for IRB approval or PHI access.”

“I need to ensure our AI initiatives have diverse and bias-mitigated datasets.”


Top Use Cases:

Synthetic training datasets for disease prediction models

Bias correction and data augmentation for underrepresented cohorts

Continuous updating of models with latest clinical knowledge


User Flow:

1. Initiate project in model development portal


2. Specify population attributes (e.g. age 60+, female, diabetic, Black patients)


3. Request synthetic EHR export or access via API


4. Validate synthetic data coverage and realism


5. Feed data into internal ML pipelines


6. Use agent-generated literature references for model documentation


7. Report outcomes to AI governance board

2. Chief Medical Officer (CMO) / VP Clinical Development

JTBD:

“I need to design clinical trials that anticipate challenges in recruitment and response variability.”

“I need to justify our trial protocols to regulators and internal review boards.”


Top Use Cases:

Trial protocol simulation using synthetic cohorts

Modeling patient dropout or adverse event risks

Identifying synthetic digital twins for patients with rare diseases


User Flow:

1. Define inclusion/exclusion criteria for trial


2. Generate synthetic population with matching characteristics


3. Run simulated trial outcomes with variation in adherence, comorbidities


4. Evaluate feasibility, protocol risks, and recruitment time


5. Share results with CROs and internal stakeholders

3. Head of RWE / VP HEOR

JTBD:

“I need to generate evidence of product effectiveness and cost-efficiency in real-world-like populations.”

“I need data to support payer negotiations, post-market surveillance, and value-based contracting.”


Top Use Cases:

Augment RWE analyses with synthetic control arms

Simulate health economic outcomes for budget impact models

Fill data gaps in payer submissions


User Flow:

1. Select product or indication under analysis


2. Identify real-world outcomes of interest (e.g., readmission rates, costs)


3. Generate synthetic control or treatment populations


4. Run economic modeling and outcomes simulations


5. Export payer-facing deliverables, supported by literature crawled by AI agents

4. SVP AI/ML / Chief Innovation Officer

JTBD:

“I need to explore and deploy cutting-edge tools that reduce costs, de-risk experiments, and accelerate time to insight.”

“I need to future-proof our data infrastructure with privacy-safe alternatives.”


Top Use Cases:

Internal synthetic data sandboxes for experimentation

Stress testing AI/ML models against rare or edge-case scenarios

Benchmarking LLM tools using synthetic patient narratives


User Flow:

1. Launch pilot initiative for AI model training or evaluation


2. Generate synthetic datasets tailored to a use case (e.g., cancer, heart failure)


3. Run comparative model testing with synthetic vs real-world data


4. Evaluate performance, generalizability, bias


5. Present to CTO or Board as ROI-positive innovation

5. Head of Regulatory Affairs / VP Quality

JTBD:

“I need to ensure we meet regulatory data standards and can demonstrate safety, bias mitigation, and generalizability.”

“I need to help teams prepare for pre-submission or FDA audits using compliant data.”


Top Use Cases:

Generate diverse synthetic validation sets to prove model fairness

Simulate post-market surveillance conditions

Build FDA/EMA-ready documentation with up-to-date citations


User Flow:

1. Select AI model or drug submission project


2. Generate synthetic validation datasets based on label criteria


3. Use agent-validated citations to support data lineage


4. Run safety, efficacy, and bias impact tests


5. Submit synthetic-backed reports alongside primary submission




---

Clinical Data Scientist / Bioinformatician / Trial Ops (Power Users)

JTBD:

“I need accurate, representative datasets that let me simulate scenarios, test hypotheses, and refine models faster.”


User Flows:

1. Launch workspace (sandbox, notebook, Langflow, or API)


2. Define population schema and desired variables


3. Select update cadence (daily/weekly via AI agents crawling PubMed, Trials.gov, etc.)


4. Receive exportable dataset + metadata


5. Run model training, outcome analysis, or dashboarding


6. Push results to decision-makers or integrate with existing R&D workflows
