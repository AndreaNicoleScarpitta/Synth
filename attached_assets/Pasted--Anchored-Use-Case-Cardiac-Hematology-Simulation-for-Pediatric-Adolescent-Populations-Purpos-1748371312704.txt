üî¨ Anchored Use Case: Cardiac Hematology Simulation for Pediatric & Adolescent Populations
üéØ Purpose of This Demo

To simulate realistic, longitudinal synthetic EHR data for children with cardiac and hematologic comorbidities (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot + anemia), enabling users to:

    Train AI models for early detection or risk stratification

    Test safety of therapeutic interventions

    Generate synthetic control arms for rare disease trials

    Simulate hemodynamic and hematologic interactions across growth stages
