🎯 Target User & Use Case

We’re building for a combination of users, but the initial focus is on AI developers and pharma researchers who:

    Need synthetic patient data to train or validate AI models without PHI risk

    Are exploring disease-specific modeling, especially in rare or underrepresented conditions

    Require literature-backed validation of synthetic cohorts to build trust and meet compliance or publication standards

Secondary users will include clinicians or academic researchers conducting feasibility studies or population health analysis, especially where access to real data is limited.
🔁 Core Workflow

The MVP should support this workflow:

    User inputs a research query or clinical objective
    (e.g. “How does drug X affect women with hypertension and diabetes?”)

    System retrieves related literature
    (via agentic search on PubMed, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov)

    Agent validates query coverage and identifies gaps
    (e.g. “Only 3 studies mention this combination in females over 60”)

    Synthetic EHR cohort is generated using predefined criteria
    (population simulation, time series, clinical notes)

    Structured answer is returned, optionally with:

        Comparison to real-world statistics (if available)

        Critique of dataset bias

        Visualizations (e.g., adverse event rates, comorbidity charts)

We see this as Literature + Simulation → Structured Evidence.
📚 Data Sources & Synthetic Models
Research Data:

    PubMed, bioRxiv (initially via crawling + E-utilities API)

    ClinicalTrials.gov and guideline repositories

    Later: add research summarization and triage (QA agents)

Synthetic Data:

    We’re considering:

        Synthea (for structured, FHIR-compatible data)

        LangChain + LLMs (via Ollama) to generate synthetic clinical notes, labs, timelines

        BIOGPT and MedLLaMA models for domain-aligned language

We'll validate outputs using:

    Predefined patient cohort templates

    Agent-based critique systems (for realism, bias, representation)

    Rule-based sanity checks (e.g., does the cohort follow plausible physiology?)

⚙️ Technical Preferences

    Local-first with agentic control, tunneled to Replit for frontend development

    Using:

        Langflow + LangChain for orchestration

        Ollama for local model inference (Mistral, BIOGPT, etc.)

        ChromaDB for lightweight RAG

    Preference for open-source tools that can scale to on-premise or HIPAA-aligned environments

    Goal: eventually serve models behind secure APIs or in clinical research sandboxes

🧱 Next Steps (with your help)

We’d love help on:

    MVP architecture — agent loops, vector store config, modularity

    LangChain design patterns for chaining retrieval + generation + critique

    Scaffolding:

        Synthetic cohort generation agent

        Literature triage agent

        FastAPI/Streamlit UI

    Integrating dataset diversity validation and bias critique agents
