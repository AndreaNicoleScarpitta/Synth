Here’s a clean, structured Replit prompt for this second use case—focused on synthetic EHR generation, adversarial validation, and researcher-facing transparency:


---

Prompt:

> I’m building a full-stack, open-source platform to create and validate multimodal synthetic EHR data with real-time feedback and auditability. This will run in Replit using agentic AI workflows.




---

Requirements:

1. Synthetic EHR Generation

Enable users to input a clinical context or research question (e.g., “simulate late-stage renal failure in Type 2 diabetics with comorbid hypertension”).

Use BIOGPT and other open-source clinical LLMs (e.g., MedAlpaca, ClinicalCamel, GatorTron) to generate:

Structured: vitals, labs, demographics, diagnoses

Unstructured: clinical notes, radiology impressions

Multimodal: optional time series (e.g., vitals), imaging placeholders, waveform



2. Interface for Data Access

Build a lightweight front-end UI or dashboard where users can:

View approved synthetic records

Filter by cohort, modality, generation date, etc.

Access rejected/flagged records and see exactly why they failed



3. Adversarial Agent Validation Layer

Pass all generated records through two or more configurable agents:

Realism Agent: Validates realism using statistical profiles or comparisons to gold-standard public datasets (e.g., MIMIC, eICU, Synthea)

Relevance Agent: Validates that the record aligns with the stated research question or problem prompt


Each agent's tolerance/skepticism level can be tuned (like LLM temperature)


4. Audit & Transparency

Every generated record should be:

Logged with who generated it, what agents rejected it, and why

Version-controlled with clear lineage and traceability

Accompanied by a summary report (e.g., “Rejected for implausible comorbidity profile”)



5. Tech Stack

LLMs: BioGPT (Ollama or HuggingFace), ClinicalGPT, MedLLaMA2

Validation models: Use statistical profile matchers, ICD-10 co-occurrence validators, ontology mappers

Database:

PostgreSQL for structured EHR

MongoDB for agent logs, notes, and state

Object storage (e.g., MinIO) for imaging/waveform placeholders


Langflow or FastAPI + Streamlit UI for orchestration & interface

Temporal or Prefect for agent orchestration

RAG support: ChromaDB or FAISS for background knowledge


6. Future Extension

Add ability for researchers to tune agent criteria and submit synthetic datasets for external publication or validation



---

Deliverables

A fully working Replit or local-dev scaffold

API to:

Trigger EHR generation

Retrieve validated records

View failure reasons


UI with:

Cohort filtering

Validation toggle views

Agent heatmaps or explainability visuals

Let me know if you want this exported as a scaffolded repo, a Langflow diagram, or a zip you can drag into Replit to get started.
