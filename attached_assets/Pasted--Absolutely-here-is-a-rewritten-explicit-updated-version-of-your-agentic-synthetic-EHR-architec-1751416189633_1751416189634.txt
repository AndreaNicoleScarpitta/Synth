🌟 Comprehensive Agentic Synthetic EHR Architecture — Updated for Practical Implementation


---

✅ Foundational Principles (with Updates)

Lossless design: all prior functions explicitly preserved

Roles explicit:

Doer Sub-Agents → actively generate/transform data

Coordinator Sub-Agents → orchestrate, sequence, validate doers

Adversarial Sub-Agents → stress-test and break doers


Version pinning introduced (🔄 Update: needed for reproducibility and replay determinism; vocabularies and external code sets are frozen per run and stored alongside provenance)

Concurrency strategy defined (🔄 Update: Priority queue and lock-based concurrency patterns implemented to prevent coordinator deadlock)

Data re-identification safeguards added (🔄 Update: integrate differential privacy/k-anonymity score estimation as part of the QA Bias & Fairness Monitor to ensure irreversibility of synthetic records)

Clinical Realism Certification (🔄 Update: added SME sign-off flow after generation, before QA, to verify plausible, medically defensible patterns)

Automated ontology update sub-agent (🔄 Update: handles quarterly SNOMED/LOINC/ICD updates automatically, while maintaining pinned versions for replays)

Human-in-the-loop SLA definition (🔄 Update: designed Priority Router with escalation thresholds, reviewer bandwidth, and failure criteria to avoid overload)

Stress/scale performance targets included (🔄 Update: minimum throughput and max latency targets set for adversarial campaign orchestration)

Fully modular, scalable, auditable

Regulatory-friendly with explainability, fairness, bias monitoring, and provenance

Aligned with Temporal, Prefect, or comparable orchestration

Reinforcement feedback loop for RAG hallucination detection (🔄 Update: bias and QA modules will feed back to retriever to reduce hallucinations over time)
