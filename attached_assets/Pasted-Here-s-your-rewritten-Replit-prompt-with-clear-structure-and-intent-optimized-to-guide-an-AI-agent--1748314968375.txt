Here’s your rewritten Replit prompt with clear structure and intent, optimized to guide an AI agent or developer workspace setup:


---

Prompt:

> I’m building an agentic AI system on Replit and need a full-stack architecture for generating synthetic, multimodal EHR records from a problem statement, not a search query.

Requirements:

1. Live Agent Visibility

I want real-time visibility into the agents performing tasks (e.g., data generation, validation, insertion).

Include an interface or logs to track agent status and outputs.



2. Agent Workflow

The user provides a clinical problem statement (e.g., “suspected autoimmune flare in adolescent female”).

From this, agents use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to generate synthetic EHR records—structured (lab values, vitals), unstructured (notes), and time-series data.



3. Databases (Multi-layered)

SQL DB (e.g., PostgreSQL): For structured EHR data (labs, encounters, demographics)

Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j): For relationships across patient history, diagnosis chains, and timelines

Document DB (e.g., MongoDB): For storing unstructured notes, external references, agent output states

Object Storage (e.g., MinIO or local blob store): For saving multimodal assets (e.g., synthetic images, waveform data)



4. Audit & Explainability

Every agent action must be auditable. Store logs of inputs, prompts, outputs, and downstream effects.

Create traceability across the orchestration DAG.



5. Orchestration Engine

Use Temporal or a similar open-source orchestrator to manage multi-step agent flows

Ensure that workflows are resumable, inspectable, and support retries



6. Output

A Langflow-style visual graph of the agent flow

Reusable pipeline template to create and validate synthetic patient records from a single input problem






> Build the full architecture and example implementation to run in Replit, using open source packages only.
Bonus: Include APIs to trigger flows and retrieve patient data by synthetic cohort.

Let me know if you want a pre-scaffolded Replit project or want this as a Langflow flow instead.
